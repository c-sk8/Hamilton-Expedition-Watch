# Hamilton Expedition Black

This clock or watch design is based on the: **Hamilton Khaki Field Expedition Automatic**

If I am breaking any copyright rules by copying the design of this watch then I am happy to remove
this project. I have no connection to Hamilton, other than being a fan of their designs.

The **SVG** files have been made by exporting code from the **Affinity Designer 2** file.

Using your browser to **zoom in** or **zoom out** you can change the size of the clock.
Because it is made using SVG files it looks good at any size. I have only tested
using the Safari browser on my Mac and iPhone.

The end result can be viewed here: https://c-sk8.github.io/hamilton/

# Hamilton Expedition Black

This clock or watch design is based on the: **Hamilton Khaki Field Expedition Automatic**

If I am breaking any copyright rules by copying the design of this watch then I am happy to remove
this project. I have no connection to Hamilton, other than being a fan of their designs.

This project uses hand crafted **SVG** files made by exporting code from the 
**Affinity Designer 2** file.

In summary this project uses the following code files:

- SVG
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML

Using your browser to zoom in or out you can change the size of the clock.
Because it is made using SVG files it looks good at any size. I have only tested
using the Safari browser on my Mac and iPhone.

The end result can be viewed here:

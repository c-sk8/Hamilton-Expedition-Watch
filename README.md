# Hamilton Expedition Black

This clock or watch design is based on the:

**Hamilton Khaki Field Expedition Automatic**

If I am breaking any copyright rules by copying the design of this watch then I am happy to remove
this project, but I am a big fan Hamilton watches and the designs they use.

This project uses hand crafted **SVG** files made by exporting code from the **Affinity Designer 2** file.

In summary this project uses the following code files:

- SVG
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML

Using your browser to zoom in or out you can change the size of the clock.
Because it is made using SVG files it looks good at any size.

The end result can be viewed here:
